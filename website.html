    <h1>Project Vision</h1>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to develop a system that can mine the Netlog data to measure the Internet performance of the users. The system will use the speedtest data from the Netlog data to measure the Internet performance of the users. The system will be able to measure the download speed, upload speed, and latency of the users. The system will also be able to measure the performance of the users' Internet connection over time. The system will be able to provide the users with a detailed report of their Internet performance. The system will also be able to provide the users with recommendations on how to improve their Internet performance.
